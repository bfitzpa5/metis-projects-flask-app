  For our second project, we were tasked with building a linear regression model using information scraped from the web.
  I choose to analyze the relationship between opening weekend movie revenue and economic and political indicators.
</p>
<p>
  Opening weekend revenue accounts for 37% of domestic total revenue, so the implications of a strong vs weak opening week are immense.
  Being able to contextualize releases by the current economic and political situations would enable movie producers to better estimate expected returns.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">DataSet</h2>
<p>
  For this project, I first scraped 100 largest grossing domestic films from each year between 1980 and 2017 from
  <a href="http://www.boxofficemojo.com/">BoxOfficeMojo</a> to obtain opening weekend gross revenue.
</p>
<p>
  I then choose some commonly used economic and political indicators,
  adjusting monetary measures for inflation using the Consumer Price Index (CCI):
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Presidential Approval Rating: The American Presidency Project</li>
  <li>Federal Voter Turnout Rate: United States Elections Project</li>
  <li>Real US GDP: Federal Bank of St. Louis</li>
  <li>Consumer Confidence Index:  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)</li>
  <li>Unemployment Rate: Bureau of Labor Statistics</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The next challenge was to determine the scale to use for each statistic, since each of these has different time frame for when it is reflected.
  To do so, I used rolling means per the below chart.
</p>
<table class="table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Category</th>
      <th scope="col">Data Input Measurement</th>
      <th scope="col">Centered Mean Adjustment</th>
      <th scope="col">Mean Adjustment Size</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Approval Rating</td>
      <td>3 Day</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>11</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>GDP</td>
      <td>Quarterly</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>CCI</td>
      <td>Monthly</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Unemployment Rate</td>
      <td>Quarterly</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Voter Turnout Rate</td>
      <td>Bi-annual</td>
      <td>N/A</td>
      <td>N/A</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2 class="section-heading">Analysis</h2>
<p>After having collected the data, I ran an initial regression with all data points included.</p>
<p><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='02-luther/firstRegressionStats.png') }}" alt="firstRegressionStats"></p>
<p>
  This left a pretty low R-squared of 0.047.
  When we delved deeper into the data it become apparent that there wasn’t much correlation going on between the economic and political indicators and the opening weekend revenue.
</p>
<p><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='02-luther/correlations.png') }}" alt="correlations"></p>
<p>To visualize this, below are a few plots.</p>
<div class="container content-margins">
  <div class="row">
    <a class="col-md-4">
      <img class="img-fluid" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='02-luther/openingGrossvsGDP.png') }}" alt="openingGrossvsGDP">

    <a class="col-md-4">

    <a class="col-md-4">
      <img class="img-fluid" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='02-luther/openingGrossvsUnemployment.png') }}" alt="openingGrossvsUnemployment">

  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <a class="col-md-6">
      <img class="img-fluid" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='02-luther/openingGrossvsApproval.png') }}" alt="openingGrossvsApproval">

    <a class="col-md-6">
      <img class="img-fluid" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='02-luther/openGrossvsVoterTurnout.png') }}" alt="openGrossvsVoterTurnout">
    </a>
</div>
<p>
  It seems that people attend the movies irregardless of the political and economic situation.
  Although this isn’t a completely suprising conclusion, it was interesting to see this reflected in the data.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Further Improvements</h2>
<p>
  Since we weren’t able to find any patterns from the economic and political indicators and opening weekend gross revenue, the question arose, what is determinant of this statistic?
  To find out, I rescraped box office mojo for some additional data related to films.
</p>
<div class="container content-margins">
  <div class="row text-center text-lg-left">
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <a class="d-block mb4 h-100">
        <img class="img-fluid img-thumbnail" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='02-luther/openGrossvsSharedReleases.png') }}" alt="openGrossvsSharedReleases">
      </a>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <a class="d-block mb4 h-100">
        <img class="img-fluid img-thumbnail" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='02-luther/openingGrossvsProductionBudget.png') }}" alt="openingGrossvsProductionBudget">
      </a>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <a class="d-block mb4 h-100">
        <img class="img-fluid img-thumbnail" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='02-luther/openGrossvsWidestRelease.png') }}" alt="openGrossvsWidestRelease">
      </a>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>
  Clearly, more traditional movie metrics are more determinant of the opening weekend gross revenue for a film.
  Using this data, I designed an initial second regression model as shown below.
</p>
<p><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='02-luther/secondRegression.png') }}" alt="secondRegression"></p>
<p>The R-squared from this data shows it is much more explanatory.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Takeways</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Domain Knowledge</em></strong>
      Although this project wasn’t a huge success, it showed me the importance of having a strong hypthesis before starting a data science project.
      When I initial designed it, I just had a very general idea; I didn’t use any domain knowledge.
      Instead, I have realized how important it is to instead really think through whether a relationship exists.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Budgeting Time</em></strong>
      I spent a bit too much time pulling the economic and political dataset, which left me with less time for analysis.
      A big lesson here was that you have to keep your head up and realize if gathering the data is taking too much time.
      It is important to slot extra time for analysis, since there might be additional problems there you might not see coming!
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Patience</em></strong>
      Finally, a big part of this project was how humbling it was.
      Being a data scientist will definitely be hard work, and it won’t come over night.
      A lot of the initial experience will be getting through projects like this, where it’s a bit of a struggle.
      During these times, it important to use them as opportunities to learn a lot.
