      <p>Hi! My name is Brendan Fitzpatrick. I am currently a student at Columbia University getting a certificate of Quantitative Studies for Finance. Through this program, I have taken courses in Linear Algebra, Convex Optimization, Analysis, Programming in Java, Data Structures, Probability Theory and Statistical Inference. I graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 2012.</p>
      <p>Over the summer I went to Metisâ€™ Data Science Bootcamp in order to transition careers to data science. Prior to that, I worked as a corporate paralegal at Simpson, Thacher and Bartlett LLP and an analyst at the Blackstone Group. This blog is a chance for me to share my experiences at Metis and my projects.</p>
      <p>Enjoy!</p>
