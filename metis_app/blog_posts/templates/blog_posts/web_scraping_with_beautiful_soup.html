  When no API is available, the best way to acquire data programmatically is through web scraping.
  This entails searching a website's HTML for data across different pages.
  The fact that most website pages are based off templates allow multiple pages to be scraped with the same logic.
</p>
<p>
  An example would be scraping movie data from <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/">Box Office Mojo</a>.
  To do so, we'll use <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/">BeautifulSoup</a>, a python packages that takes in an html page and allows you to traverse the DOM.
  Using two functions, we'll obtain data on a movie's page for many fields.
</p>
<pre class="language-python"><code>{% include 'include_docs/web_scraping_with_beautiful_soup/code1.py' %}</code></pre>
<p>
  This returns a dictionary with the data from the site.
  For example, the cinematic classic <em>Minions</em>...
</p>
<pre class="language-python"><code>{% include 'include_docs/web_scraping_with_beautiful_soup/code2.py' %}</code></pre>
<p>will return:</p>
<pre class="language-python"><code>{% include 'include_docs/web_scraping_with_beautiful_soup/code3.py' %}</code></pre>
<p>
  *** Addendum: the site structure has changed so this won't work anymore unfortunately.
  But, believe me, it did at one point!
